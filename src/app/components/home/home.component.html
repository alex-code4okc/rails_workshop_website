    Women are underrepresented in the tech market. We want to change that. The OKC Rails Workshop is an event for <em>women attendees only</em> that serves as an introduction to web development. Our goal is to provide a supportive, welcoming environment that empowers women to become developers, designers, engineers, or simply spark a new hobby. Using the powerful Ruby on Rails framework, attendees will learn how to build their very own websites. We hope that you will join us.

  <h2>Ruby on Rails</h2>
  <p>
    Websites have a lot of moving pieces. Ruby on Rails (or simply Rails) is a set of tools that automate a lot of the development process. It enables to you get a fully-functioning website up in minutes so that you can focus on making a great-looking, great-functioning website for your users.
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe the Rails serves as a great introduction to web development because it provides a clear, accessible path to producing web applications. After the workshop there are countless additional resources and tutorials to help you continue learning and growing.
