  <h2>Ruby on Rails</h2>
  <p>
    Websites have a lot of moving pieces. <a href='https://rubyonrails.org/'>Ruby on Rails</a> (or simply Rails) is a set of tools that automate a lot of the development process. It enables to you get a fully-functioning website up in minutes so that you can focus on making a great-looking, great-functioning website for your users.
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe the Rails serves as a great introduction to web development because it provides a clear, accessible path to producing web applications. After the workshop there are countless additional resources and tutorials to help you continue learning and growing.
