<h2>Can men come?</h2>
<h2>This is for women. Why are men allowed to be coaches?</h2>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<h2>Do I need my own computer?</h2>
<h2>Is food provided?</h2>
<h2>I have kids. Can I bring them?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately everyone at the workshop must be 18 years or older.</p>
<h2>What if I can't make it on time or have to leave early?</h2>
<h2>What if I don't finish?</h2>
<h2>What all do I need to bring?</h2>
<h2>So, what comes next?</h2>
<h2>I'm under 18, can I still come?</h2>
